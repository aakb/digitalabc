# Digital ABC

## Information
This is the Digital ABC project. It is a Symfony2 project that utilises angularjs.

To allow the AngularJS integration within a twig template the interpolation symbols have changed for angular from {{ }} to <[ ]>.

We use uglifyjs to compile the javascripts into one file. See Helpful commands for the command to compile the scripts.

### To update the project on the server
Pull from git (from root of project)
<pre>
git pull
</pre>
Clear cache
<pre>
rm -rf app/cache/*
</pre>
Run the uglifyjs script (To compile the javascripts to one file)
<pre>
php app/console assetic:dump
</pre>

### Helpful commands

To watch for changes in the javascripts
<pre>
app/console assetic:dump --watch
</pre>
To clear cache

app/console cache:clear
</pre>

## Installation instructions
### Get composer
With brew (global install)
<pre>
$ brew install composer
</pre>

Without brew. Go to project directory:

<pre>
$ curl -sS http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
</pre>

This will download composer.phar to the project directory.

### Install dependencies for project
With brew:
<pre>
$ composer install
</pre>

Without brew:
<pre>
$ php composer.phar install
</pre>

If there are problems with this, try with apc.enable_cli = Off in php.ini or from the cli:
<pre>
php -d apc.enable_cli=Off composer.phar install
</pre>

### Setup project
<pre>
$ cp app/config/parameters.yml.dist app/config/parameters.yml
</pre>

Fill in relevant settings.

### Setup DB and after changing an entity
<pre>
$ php app/console doctrine:schema:update
</pre>
(--force)

### Fix permissions
Make sure the webserver has access to
<pre>
app/cache/
app/logs/
</pre>

Furthermore, make sure the webserver has access to
<pre>
web/images/
</pre>
which is the folder where the uploaded images will reside.

### Set up webserver
